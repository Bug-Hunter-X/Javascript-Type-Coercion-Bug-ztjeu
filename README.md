# Javascript Type Coercion Bug
This example demonstrates a common Javascript bug caused by type coercion with the + operator.
Javascript will perform string concatenation if one operand is a string, even if the other is a number. 
The solution involves explicit type checking or using a more suitable method for string concatenation.
